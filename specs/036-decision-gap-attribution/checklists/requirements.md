# Specification Quality Checklist: Decision-Gap Attribution

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-08-11
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [X] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [X] Focused on user value and business needs
- [X] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [X] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [X] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [X] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [X] Success criteria are measurable
- [X] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [X] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [X] Edge cases are identified
- [X] Scope is clearly bounded
- [X] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [X] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [X] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [X] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [X] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- This is a pure-diagnostic feature: zero model calls, zero decision changes, zero engine edits, no eval baseline.
- The exact 33/1411/1378 numbers are frozen benchmark outcomes to be reproduced from the real 034/035 data; the
  offline fixture proves the rebuild logic first.
- 035 cross-validation is optional and degrades explicitly to `audit_unavailable`; it never blocks the report.
